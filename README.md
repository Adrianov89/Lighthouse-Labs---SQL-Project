# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

My goal is to assist aspiring e-commerce entrepreneurs in understanding the market and making informed decisions for success.

## Process
### 1: Load the available data into PostgreSQL's PgAdmin for easier manipulation.
### 2: Clean the data and decide which columns are relevant to my report.
### 3: Answer initial questions provided by stakeholders.
### 4: Ask further questions that may add value to the investigation.
### 5: Display insights and conclusions. 

## Results
### 1: E-commerce expansion looks like it will not stop in the near future. 
### 2: The USA is the current biggest market with 92% of revenue coming from there (most likely, this dataset is from a USA website).
### 3: There are other emerging players with bigger 'Conversion Rate' than USA, such as Israel and Switzerland. These markets should not be underseen.
### 4: The top 3 months with the highest revenue are November, July, and December. It's recommended to launch a couple of months before to seize the wave. The recommended months to launch are May and September.
### 5: People who buy more tend to spend less than 5 minutes and check between 5-10 listings, which indicates that people do not spend too much searching. It is essential to have a good listing with great pictures to incentivize people to buy without searching further. 


## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

### The dataset was pretty dirty, with lots of blanks and no clear relations between the tables. Also, many columns were not clear.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

### Honestly, I would try to find other datasets more complete, clear, and accurate.
